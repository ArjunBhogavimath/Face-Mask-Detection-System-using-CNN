• It is a real-time face mask detection system built using deep learning architecture. I used MobileNetV2 architecture in CNN because it is light weight, and I used transfer learning method to train the data-sets.
• The Goal is to avoid people from entering any premises like classrooms and office rooms without mask. When a person entering into the room the camera captures the face and detects if he is wearing a mask or not, If he wears mask it will allow, If not then it will give beep sound to avoid him from entering.
Technology used: Python, TensorFlow, Mobile-Net V2, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook
